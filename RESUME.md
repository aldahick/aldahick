  - and frontends: React, Vue, Bootstrap/jQuery
  - and interfaces: GraphQL, (g)RPC, REST, Websockets, TCP/UDP sockets
  - and stores: Postgres, MariaDB, Redis, MongoDB
- Devops: See above - it's not just about writing pages and endpoints!
  - with containers: Docker (compose), Kubernetes, AWS ECS
  - and pipelines: Github Actions, CircleCI, Buildkite, Jenkins
  - and infra-as-code: Terraform. Just a lot of Terraform.
  - and clouds: Years spent watching the AWS Console evolve to be _slightly_ better
