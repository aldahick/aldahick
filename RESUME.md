## Skills

I'm a pretty solid violinist, more of an amateur cyclist, and an atrocious singer. But, professionally:

- Node.JS, Typescript, and React, everything you'd want in a modern full-stack dev
- Docker, CircleCI, and all kinds of AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, and RDS, to name a few)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL, because we all like data and doing stuff with it
- REST / GraphQL API design
- Team leadership and system architecture
