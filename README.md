You might check out [Athena](https://github.com/aldahick/athena), a web API framework with all kinds of opinionation and streamlining. Like an aero bike, but less expensive.

Or, if basic continuous deployment is more your jam, [this very repo](https://github.com/aldahick/aldahick) hosts my resume and associated code.

[Many other miscellaneous projects](https://github.com/aldahick?tab=repositories) await your scrutiny â€” or, just [talk to me](alex@alexhicks.net)!
