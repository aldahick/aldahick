### hello

Currently trying to keep fraud from happening @ [NS8](https://github.com/ns8inc) which is pretty cool

#### my favorite things

- [Athena](https://github.com/aldahick/athena), a web API framework with all kinds of opinionation and power
- Rex ([API](https://github.com/aldahick/rex-api) and [front-end](https://github.com/aldahick/rex-web)), a big dumping ground for the fun ideas I come up with.

My repositories are littered with neat stuff that I don't want to delete, and terrible stuff that I'm afraid to delete.

If you want to talk to me for some reason, I guess email me? Or send a carrier pigeon somewhere
