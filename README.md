Hi! I'm Alex, and I've been doing this to myself for 8 years. Thankfully most of my employers in that time have used Github, because I spend a lot of time here anyways! For instance, I'm learning Rust by making a [map game](https://github.com/aldahick/mapgame), and implementing some hard-learned GraphQL practices in a Typescript package [@athenajs/core](https://github.com/aldahick/athena). Previously, I've dabbled in everything from [games](https://github.com/aldahick/dotter) to [auto-generated VMware clients](https://github.com/hyperqube-io/vsphere-soap) to [MVC frameworks](https://github.com/crossroads-education?q=eta&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers). I'm also a violinist, cellist, and cyclist; so if I'm not writing, I'm likely dodging potholes or repeating measures. (I'm looking for a job! If you like what you've seen so far, I'm probably a great fit. [Let's talk](mailto:alex@alexhicks.net)!)
